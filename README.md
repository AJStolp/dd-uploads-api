This is the backend for the DD-Uploads site.

The languages used are Node.js and Express

The database used is Postgresql

It is put online using Heroku and the database is using Heroku Postgres

I had a few challenges while building this app. First, It was tricky to get Heroku to read the .Json file that Google Cloud Issues for their credentials. After Trying a few different ways and a lot of Googling - I was able to figure out. An additional challenge was working with JWT for the first time. This App was a huge learning opportunity! I hope you enjoy!
